    (*  The following are known as higher order functions: 
        
        (1) iter 
        (2) map 
        (3) filter 
        (4) reduce 
        (5) forall 
        (6) exists 
                
        because they apply a function to a list in a common way. 
        
        Abstracting away the mechanics of an operation is one of the
        ways that functinal programming promotes a declarative style.*)
